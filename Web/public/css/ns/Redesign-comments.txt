1. It would be nice to have some freedom for project style tags and style's properties not imposed by the global styles of EBI header and footer, i.e. table, td, tr, th, padding, margin, font for headers h1, h2 etc. Otherwise it should be proposed in separate style sheet file for inner projects/web-application only (without header in footer style definitions). The present style interfere severely to the view of the current project.

Example: table, tr,td tags definitions in http://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/web_guidelines/css/compliance/develop/ebi-visual.css
— this crashes tables view in the inner project and global typography there * {} definition also make some troubles
2. In existing css files some tag definition override themselves several times (h1, h2 etc). Ideally the best solution might look like every tag for header/footer has its own local namespace, i.e. similar to already implemeted
div#global-footer h3.services {color: #207a7a;}

3. Eventually there are only 2 css files we might need (now 5 are suggested…): 
(1) global mandatory style sheet for header and footer with local namespaces not interfering inner project namespaces; 
(2) optional recommended style sheet for inner project including suggested desktop view for web application (zebra-style row iteration in tables, popup ajax-windows and so on)

4. It's a bit embarrassing to have such a big file just for texture underlayer: http://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/web_guidelines/images/global/pale_grey_slight_texture.jpg

5. The present footer override content on long pages of big height, i.e. with former design everything is OK here:
http://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/fg/sym/reagent/AMBN10046139:ENSG00000143458 — footer is stable and doesn't run against the content, but the current footer does…
